Introduction

This is my final year project on parent-institution interaction: a web-based application.
The project aims to allow institutions - a case study of Fountain University Osogbo Osun State collaborate and pass information to the parents while avoiding the influence of the student and using improved technology.

This app is proposed to allow sending of student results, attendance, payment balances, and important events/notifications.
